      <h1 align ="center" font="sans serif">3 Places in India Where You Can Feel the Presence of God</h1>
</u></b></h1>

      <Article>
        <p>India isn’t just a country. It’s a canvas painted with faith, tradition, and the kind of quiet power that makes you feel small in the most profound way. These five places aren't just tourist spots—they’re portals to something deeper, a reminder that, maybe, there’s more to life than what’s in front of us. If you ever find yourself looking for a reason to pause, these are the places that will remind you that the divine isn’t so far out of reach.</p>

    <h1><b><u> 1. Varanasi</u></b></h1>

        <p>Varanasi isn't for the faint-hearted. It’s raw, it’s intense, and it refuses to let you ignore the bigger picture of existence. Walk along the ghats and you’ll see the entire cycle of life play out before your eyes. People pray, people burn, people wash. The Ganges here isn’t just a river—it’s a symbol of both death and renewal. It’s chaotic, but in the midst of all that noise, you might just hear the quiet hum of something bigger. Something that reminds you that everything, even the most ordinary moments, is connected to something eternal.</p>

     <h1><b><u> 2. Amritsar</u></b></h1>

         <p>The Golden Temple is dazzling, yes, but it’s the silence that hits hardest. Not just the silence of the temple itself, but the silence of service. The langar, where people from all walks of life sit side by side, eating the same humble meal, is a reminder that spirituality isn’t about what you wear or how many prayers you recite. It’s about the act of giving. The idea that divinity flows not just through rituals, but through the everyday kindness that binds us all.</p>
 <br>
     <h1><b><u>3. Rishikesh</u></b></h1>

       <p>Rishikesh is where you come to let go of the noise in your head and reconnect with the quiet parts of yourself. It’s not about the yoga poses or the river’s roar (though both do wonders)—it’s the way the stillness seeps in. The Ganges here is like a mirror, reflecting your mind, while the mountains stand like quiet witnesses to your thoughts. If you ever needed a place to remember that your worth isn’t measured by what you do, but by what you are, Rishikesh will gently remind you.</p>
